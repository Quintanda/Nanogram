## How to Play

- Each number represents a group of consecutive filled cells.
- There must be at least one empty cell marked by an X between groups.
- Use logic to deduce which cells should be filled.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective:** The goal is to fill in the cells based on the number hints provided.

2. **Filling Cells:** Click on a cell to fill it. Select the X button to mark it with an 'X' if you think it should be blank.

3. **Hints:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many filled cells are in each row or column.

4. **Lifes:** You have 4 chances to make a mistake, after which you must restart the level or start a different phase.
